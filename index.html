                        <b class="bolder">The second step</b> to learning mastery is to acknowledge 
                        our preconceived misconceptions about learning.

                    <p>
                        The primary culprit here is <i>notetaking</i>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The widely accepted gold standard for learning nowadays is to sit in a lecture or class, and transcribe or note take as much of what is spoken by the tutor in the belief that this will sear 
                        the information into our minds for world until end.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The reality of this practice is that we disengage with the class as we mindlessly recreate a lesser set of notes that are likely already available, diminishing the effectiveness of the class in favor for later teaching ourselves a concept based on self-created material 
                        that could very well have been transcribed incorrectly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before we continue, you must <b class="bolder">promise</b> to forego notetaking hereon.

                    <p>
                        The first step in a three step strategy, deep understanding is the core foundation to long term memory as it creates a web of neural activity in the brain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When we follow the traditional methods of memorization based on a process of wrote-learning; this is analogous to creating a singular knowledge node in our brains neural network.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Learning without understanding is how we create these standalone knowledge neurons, and their strength and our ability to recall them is heavily dependant on how fresh the material is in our head. As time passes, the node fades into oblivion and we forget.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Instead, if we prioritise first understanding a concept, our brain creates a web of knowledge, a web of related information, a conglomerate of knowledge nodes strung together into comprehensive understanding. Nodes tangled in this web are far less suceptible to fading as the strength of the node comes from the strength of the web.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We can think about it as trying to forget one specific day in our life, which is very easy, versus trying to forget an entire year of our life; much much harder.

                        If you want learning to be easy, if you want to forget about homework and arduous long hours spent trying to brand a concept into your brain, then you need to engage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>But what does effective engagement actually look like?</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Effective engagement is the process of intaking new information and seeing whether or not this new information is in alignment with your current model of understanding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You need to analyse and evaluate new information presented to you which is an active process, and when done properly one of two things happens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>1. The new information aligns with your current conceptual understand and can be added to your web of understanding.</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>2. The new information has a merge conflict with your current conceptual understanding.</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This second step is critical, and if you are distracted whilst taking notes or with some facet of life, you will miss out on this critical moment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When something doesn't add up per step 2, it is essential that you question and challenge. This is not to tell someone that they are wrong, but instead to explain your current understanding and the reasons it might not add up. 
                        Then let the teacher bridge the gaps in your understanding and help evolve you to this greater perspective of big picture understanding.

                        We have now arrived at the start of phase 2. In the first phase, we mastered the art of understanding, and it is now time we test our new found knowledge to expose any potential vulnerabilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We achieve this via a process known as adaptation where we apply our understanding to problems in a new environment or circumstance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Often we will find that our current model of understanding was not as complete and comprehensive as we initially thought, yet this is valuable feedback for us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When a gap in our knowledge and understanding is exposed, we can research and critically analyse the information need to patch up our web of understanding until it is so intricately woven that not even water seeps through.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Working for this information so to further our understanding also helps to create a sense of engagement and our brain is more likely to prioritise it, consolidating it in our mind; we worked hard for it.

                        The final step to never forgetting anything you learn ever again - Immortalizing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I know at the start of this guide, we agreed to relinquish our need to notetake, instead to prioritise our engagement and future understanding of a topic. And while notetaking should not be used as a means for understanding, it can be useful to reinforce the concept in our mind, immortalizing our understanding, our brain's web of knowing for world until end.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Only once we have a complete understanding, tried and tested via a process of application and adaptation, can we now summarize what we have learning in a set of notes, where these notes can likely be written from memory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Chances are at this point, you would even feel comfortable explaining complex concepts related to the subject in a simple and clear manner to someone with no prior knowledge or exposure to the topic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       <i>And it is in this vein that our notes should be written.</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This process is the final stepping stone to enternal understanding and while the notes are not created with the intent of being viewed again, on the odd chance some one hundred years later that you might need a refresher course, your younger self has you covered!
